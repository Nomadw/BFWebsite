Hi I'm Keyo, your general go to agony aunt. I enjoy chatting with and getting to know people, as well as gaming and I have a slight obsession with history. I can often be found at the Bristol meet doing odd jobs and supporting Bea on walks. If anything is on your mind or you have concerns at the meet, feel free to pull me aside for a private chat. I look forward to meeting you in the future!
